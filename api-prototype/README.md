# API Prototype

##Setup
To start, from the terminal:
```
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    srv/run_dev.sh
```
It currently doesn't do much

##Intent
A functional (if limited) API for registering new Land Charges (specifically bankruptcies). The functioning prototype only because...

##Purpose
Learning - persistency and consolidate virtualisation, REST & Python stuff from previous sprints.

Having an actual prototype to talk to the Insolvency Service about is unlikely at this stage.

##Credit To
[System of Record] (https://github.com/LandRegistry/system-of-record), which was shamelessly ripped off to get this started.
